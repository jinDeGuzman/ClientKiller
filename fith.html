  <p>What it's like being hispanic</p>
  <p>
    Being born hispanic has been an experience.  I'm only half hispanic which gives me a unique experience as I wouldn't say I fully relate to the culture, but I do definetley do relate to it in some ways.  This month is great as I get to reflect upon my heriage and how it has affected me.
